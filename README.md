## Prerequisites
Before setting up this project, make sure you have basic knowledge of Arduino programming and familiarize yourself with the concepts of stepper motor control, potentiometers, and keypads.

## Hardware Requirements
To build this project, you will need the following hardware components:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Stepper motor
- Potentiometer
- Keypad (4x4 or 3x4 matrix keypad)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Circuit Diagram
The circuit should be wired according to the following diagram:


## Installation
To install and run this project on your Arduino board, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Open the `stepper_control_potentiometer_keypad.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
5. Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking the "Upload" button.

## Usage
After uploading the code to your Arduino board, follow these steps to control the stepper motor:

1. Connect the potentiometer and keypad to the Arduino board based on the circuit diagram.
2. Power on the Arduino board.
3. Adjust the potentiometer to set the desired angle for the stepper motor.
4. Press the keypad buttons to control the stepper motor movement. Each button press should correspond to a specific motion, such as clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.
